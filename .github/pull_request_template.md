Thanks for submitting a PR!

Before pressing 'Create pull request' please read the checklist below.

* All code changes should be accompanied by tests. If you are not
modifying any tests, provide a short explanation of why.

* All changes to public APIs **must** be accompanied by
docs.

* Commit messages should explain _why_ you made the changes, not just what
you changed. Use an active, imperative voice and keep the subject line short.

* We strongly encourage you to sign all commits, if possible.
